# Machine-Learning-Example

The project was carried out using data collected by the Kepler telescope over the years. There are different versions of the collected data, and in the more recent versions, the parameter related to the age of the star in the system to which the KOI (Kepler Object of Interest) belongs has been removed. After preprocessing the latest release and obtaining a new dataset through a merge operation based on the KOI identifier, for which I had the stellar age, I compared the accuracies obtained by training the same models with the same parameters on both datasets. I chose to carry out the project on this topic because it seemed to me a valid application of supervised classification: determining whether an object is or is not an exoplanet, as the datasets specified for each object whether its nature was confirmed or not. For objects classified as candidates, I opted for their removal.
